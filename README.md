# Multimodal-Hate-Speech-detector
This project implements and evaluates a multimodal hate meme detection system capable of classifying memes in English and indigenous Nigerian languages as hate/non-hate.  It introduces a comparative framework between a baseline model (DistilBERT + ResNet) and a large-scale multimodal LLM (LLaVA), optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
